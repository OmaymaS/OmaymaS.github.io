I store my images in an /images/ folder in the repository and haven’t had any performance problems yet. If your website is hosted on GitHub Pages, then the images will be served up by GitHub’s super-fast content delivery network. I haven’t found the need to store them elsewhere yet, but if I wanted to migrate my images to somewhere like CloudFront, then just pointing all of my image links to a folder on that server would be easy enough.

I like the simplicity of saving an image to the /images/ folder and then linking to it in the content. The Markdown to include an image in content is simple:I store my images in an /images/ folder in the repository and haven’t had any performance problems yet.
